        data types
        - these are basically type of data that can be used and manipulated in a program
        - Numbers -> it represent both integer and floating-point. eg: 5,4,32, 4.5,0.4 etc
        - string -> it is a sequence of characters. it can be encoded with single or double     quotes. eg: 'This is Mern class',  "Kathmandu"
        - Boolean -> it represent logical entity and can have only two values : true or false.
        - array -> it is collection of multiple values. eg: ['a','b','c']
        - object -> it is the most important data-types and forms the building blocks for modern javascript. it is collection of 'key':'value' pair.
            eg: {
                'name':'Ram Sharma',
                'age':12,
                'address':'ktm'
            }
     -->
     <script>
        var num1 = 10;
        var num2 = 20;
        var result = num1 +num2

        var name='Ram'
        var status= false

        alert(`the result is ${status}`)
        var student={
                'name':'Ram Sharma',
                'age':12,
                'address':'ktm'
            }
        
         document.write(`My name is ${student.name}. i am ${student.age} years old.`)
